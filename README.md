# Vim-Presence

## Dependencies
`pip install --user pypresence`

## Installation
If you're using vim-plug as your plugin manager (as I am), create a symbolic link in ~/.vim/plugged that connects to your vim-presence folder. Then, add this inside your Plug lines in your .vimrc

`Plug '~/.vim/plugged/vim-presence'`
